# Best-of-N Jailbreaking

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper "Attacking Audio Language Models with Best-of-N Jailbreaking".

## Overview

In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of Audio Language Models (ALMs) to audio-based jailbreaks and introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a black-box jailbreaking algorithm to extract harmful information from ALMs.
